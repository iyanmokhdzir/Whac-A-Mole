This project is for self-practice only.

It's referenced from one of Kenny Yip's youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej8SatOj3V4

This is his github: https://github.com/ImKennyYip/whac-a-mole/blob/master/README.md

Additional features that I added on my own:
- Adding start and reset buttons
- Incrementing the score only when the user clicks on the tile once (instead of allowing user to click on the same tile many times and obtaining more scores)
-  Ensuring that the mole is generated on a different tile on every interval
